# Machine Learning Case Studies

## Car Price Prediction
Machine learning techniques have been used to predict used car prices. For instance, a study conducted at Stanford University used deep learning architectures to predict used car prices based on features such as make, model, mileage, etc. Another study applied several regression techniques based on supervised machine learning to predict the resale price of used cars given factors such as mileage, fuel type, fiscal power, mark, model, and the production year of the car.

## Diabetes Prediction
Machine learning and deep learning predictive models have been used for diabetes prediction. A systematic review analyzed 90 studies to find the main opportunity areas in diabetes prediction using machine learning techniques. Another study applied and compared Machine Learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Na√Øve bayes, Decision Tree) to predict diabetes.

## Credit Risk Prediction
Machine learning techniques have been used to predict credit risk. Infosys delivered a holistic credit risk analytics and management engine by combining IP assets and technology products of leading fintech enterprises. Another study looked at credit risk analysis that compares all of the well-known statistical, optimization technique (heuristic methods), and machine learning-based approaches.

## Mobile Price Prediction
Machine learning techniques have been used to predict mobile prices. A Kaggle notebook demonstrated the use of various machine learning models to predict mobile price classes based on features like battery power, 3G enabled, wifi, Bluetooth, Ram, etc. Another study looked at predicting the price of a mobile when the specifications of a mobile are given and to find the ML algorithm that predicts the price most accurately.
